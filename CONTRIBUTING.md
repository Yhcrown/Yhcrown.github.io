## About

Hi, I am **Hengchen Yuan** (袁恒宸), an undergraduate student at [SUSTech]([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)). You can call me **Yhcrown.**

My research interests are mainly in software engineering. I am excited to explore how machine learning and program analysis can be leveraged to improve software systems’ reliability and scalability. Currently I have been exposed in research areas about **Fuzzing**, **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis), **HPC** (High-Performance Computing), and **concolic execution**, and would like to explore new topics related to them.

So far, my work has detected more than **40** security vulnerabilities in several well-known software, including [Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/), [Bento4](https://www.bento4.com/), [LibTIFF](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/), and **8** of them have been assigned **CVE numbers**.

I’m a member of [Zeros Game Studio](http://zeros.group/index.html) and love making simple but fun games, if you are also interested, contact me please.

Besides studying and researching, I love **singing** and you probably see me performing at many parties and stages. I also like to play various games and I used to be a **Challenger** for the League of Legends.

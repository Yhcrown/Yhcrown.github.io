## About

Hi, I am **Hengchen Yuan** (袁恒宸), a undergraduate student at [SUSTech]([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)).

My research interest primarily lies in software engineering. I am 
       I am interested in leveraging testing, analysis, and verification techniques to make software systems more *reliable* and *robust*, especially for machine learning systems. Besides, I tremendously enjoy contributing to the open-source community.

Currently, I focus on testing deep learning libraries, which are the central infrastructure for building, training, optimizing and deploying deep learning models. Until now, my work has totally detected **275** previously unknown bugs for widely-used deep learning libraries, including [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io) and [OneFlow](https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow).

Besides deep learning libraries, I also reported more than **30** bugs for other open-source projects, such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [Moby](https://mobyproject.org), and [VSCode-Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim).

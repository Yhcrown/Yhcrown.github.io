## About

Hi, I am **Hengchen Yuan** (袁恒宸), a undergraduate student at [SUSTech]([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)). You can call me Yhcrown.

My research interest primarily lies in software engineering. I am excited to explore how machine learning and program analysis can be leveraged to improve software systems’ reliability and scalability. Currently I have been exposed to research areas about **fuzzing**, **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis), **HPC** (High-Performance Computing), and **concolic execution**, and I would love to explore new topics related to them.

So far my work has detected more than **40** security vulnerabilities in several well-known software, including [Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/), [Bento4](https://www.bento4.com/), [LibTIFF](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/), and **8** of them have been assigned **CVE numbers**.

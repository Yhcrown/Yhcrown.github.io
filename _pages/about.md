## About

Hi, I am **Hengchen Yuan** (袁恒宸), I'm a first-year PhD student at [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and advised by professor [August Shi](https://sites.utexas.edu/august/). Previously I got my Bachelor's degree from [SUSTech]([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)). My research interest lies on software testing and programing analyis.

<!-- My research interests are mainly in software engineering. I am excited to improve software systems’ reliability and scalability. Currently I have been exposed in research areas about **Fuzzing**, **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis), and would like to explore new topics related to them.

So far, my work has detected more than **40** security vulnerabilities in several well-known software, including [Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/), [Bento4](https://www.bento4.com/), [LibTIFF](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/), and **8** of them have been assigned **CVE numbers**. -->
